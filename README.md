Decision Tree Classifier for Predicting Customer Purchases
Overview
This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this project is to classify customers as likely to purchase (or not purchase) based on various features such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous interactions with the bank.

Objectives
Preprocess and clean the Bank Marketing dataset to handle missing data, categorical variables, and outliers.
Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer behavior (purchase or not purchase).
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Visualize the decision tree and interpret the results.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Description
Data Files
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
numpy for numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
scikit-learn for machine learning (Decision Tree Classifier, metrics).
graphviz (optional, for visualizing the decision tree).
Data Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values: Check and impute or remove rows with missing values.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables (e.g., job, marital, education, contact, month, poutcome) into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or scale numerical features where necessary.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or remove redundant features to improve the model.
Decision Tree Classifier
Model Building: Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the preprocessed dataset using scikit-learn.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optionally, tune hyperparameters such as maximum depth, minimum samples per split, and others to optimize the model's performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
Model Visualization
Visualize the Decision Tree: Optionally, visualize the trained decision tree using graphviz or matplotlib for better interpretability.
Key Insights & Patterns
Feature Importance: Identify the most important features influencing customer purchase behavior (e.g., age, job, previous campaign contact).
Model Performance: Discuss the classification performance and whether the Decision Tree model is overfitting or underfitting.
Target Variable Distribution: Explore how the target variable (y) is distributed, and analyze if thereâ€™s any imbalance in the classes.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer behavior based on demographic and behavioral features. The model provides insights into customer segmentation and can be used for targeted marketing campaigns. Decision trees are interpretable, which allows understanding the reasoning behind each prediction. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with other models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
